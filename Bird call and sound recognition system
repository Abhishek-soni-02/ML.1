# This project tackles the challenge of bird species identification through automated sound recognition. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, our system aims to accurately classify bird calls and songs, enabling faster and more efficient bird monitoring in the field. This technology can be instrumental in conservation efforts by facilitating population studies, habitat monitoring, and even early detection of invasive species.
